# Comedy Clash
=============

Every week, a Comedy Clash takes center stage in town, drawing both performers and audiences eager for a night of laughter. Due to the overwhelming demand from aspiring comedians, the show’s manager has created an app that gives every artist the chance to apply for the next show. In fact, anyone can showcase their talent and join the fun.

Through the app, each artist submits a brief preview of the performance they plan to bring to the stage. Guests are encouraged to leave a single rating and comment on each submission — multiple votes from the same person aren’t allowed.

At any time, users can view the upcoming Comedy Clash, which displays a list of all applicants. Each entry shows the comedian’s chosen topic, the number of ratings received, and their average score. The list is automatically sorted in descending order, from the highest-rated acts to the lowest.

On the submission detail page, all votes are displayed with the guest's nick name, comment and rating.

One day before the show, the manager will close the application process. Regardsless the app will not except new submissions when this timeline has passed and close the submissions. 
With only 5 performance spots available each week, the five comedians with the best ratings secure their place on stage. Once the window closes, no further votes can be cast, and the final rankings are locked in.
